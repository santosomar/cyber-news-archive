### Title: Tool Review: Tailsnitch, (Tue, Jan 6th)
Link: https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32602
Summary: In yesterday&&#x23&#x3b;x26&#x3b;&#x23&#x3b;39&#x3b;s podcast, I mentioned "tailsnitch", a new tool to audit Tailscale configurations. Tailscale is an easy-to-use overlay to Wireguard. It is probably best compared to STUN servers in VoIP in that it allows devices behind NAT to connect directly to each other. Tailscale just helps negotiate the setup, and once the connection is established, data will flow directly between the connected devices. I personally use it to provide remote assistance to family members, and it has worked great for this purpose. Tailscale uses a "Freemium" model. For my use case, I do not need to pay, but if you have multiple users or a large number of devices, you may need to pay a monthly fee. There are also a few features that are only available to paid accounts.&#xd;
