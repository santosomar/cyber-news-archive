### Title: 2026 64-Bits Malware Trend, (Mon, Feb 16th)
Link: https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32718

One of the conclusions is that 32-bits code is still popular because it acts like a comme denominator and allows threat actors to target more Windows computers. Yes, Microsoft Windows can smoothly execute 32-bits code on 64-bits computers. It is still the case in 2026&#x3f; Did the situation evolved&#x3f;&#xd;
