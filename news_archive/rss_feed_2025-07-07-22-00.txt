### Title: What's My (File)Name&#x3f;, (Mon, Jul 7th)
Link: https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32084
Summary: Modern malware implements a lot of anti-debugging and anti-analysis features. Today, when a malware is spread in the wild, there are chances that it will be automatically sent into a automatic analysis pipe, and a sandbox. To analyze a sample in a sandbox, it must be "copied" into the sandbox and executed. This can happen manually or automatically. When people start the analysis of a suspicious file, they usually call it "sample.exe", "malware.exe" or "suspicious.exe". It&&#x23&#x3b;x26&#x3b;&#x23&#x3b;39&#x3b;s not always a good idea because it&&#x23&#x3b;x26&#x3b;&#x23&#x3b;39&#x3b;s can be detected by the malware and make it aware that "I&&#x23&#x3b;x26&#x3b;&#x23&#x3b;39&#x3b;m being analyzed".&#xd;
