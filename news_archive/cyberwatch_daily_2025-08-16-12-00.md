### Title: SNI5GECT: Sniffing and Injecting 5G Traffic Without Rogue Base Stations, (Thu, Aug 14th)
Link: https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32202
Summary: As the world gradually adopts and transitions to using 5G for mobile, operational technology (OT), automation and Internet-of-Things (IoT) devices, a secure 5G network infrastructure remains critical. Recently, the Automated Systems SEcuriTy (ASSET) Research Group have released a new framework named SNI5GECT &#x5b;pronounced as Sni-f-Gect (sniff &#x2b; 5G &#x2b; inject)&#x5d; that enables users of the framework to i) sniff messages from pre-authentication 5G communication in real-time and ii) inject targeted attack payloads in downlink communications towards User Equipments (UE). I had previously written about how 5G connections are established over here, hence I will be diving directly into the SNI5GECT framework. In this diary, I will briefly provide an overview of the SNI5GECT framework and discuss a new multi-stage downgrade attack leveraging the SNI5GECT framework.&#xd;
