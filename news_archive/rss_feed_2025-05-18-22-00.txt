### Title: [Webinar] From Code to Cloud to SOC: Learn a Smarter Way to Defend Modern Applications
Link: https://thehackernews.com/2025/05/from-code-to-cloud-to-soc-learn-smarter.html
Summary: Modern apps move fast—faster than most security teams can keep up. As businesses rush to build in the cloud, security often lags behind. Teams scan code in isolation, react late to cloud threats, and monitor SOC alerts only after damage is done.
Attackers don’t wait. They exploit vulnerabilities within hours. Yet most organizations take days to respond to critical cloud alerts. That delay isn’t
