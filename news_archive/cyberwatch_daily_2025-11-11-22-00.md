### Title: It isn't always defaults: Scans for 3CX usernames, (Mon, Nov 10th)
Link: https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32464
Summary: Today, I noticed scans using the username "FTP&#x5f;3cx" showing up in our logs. 3CX is a well-known maker of business phone system software &#x5b;1&#x5d;. My first guess was that this was a default user for one of their systems. But Google came up empty for this particular string. The 3CX software does not appear to run an FTP server, but it offers a feature to back up configurations to an FTP server &#x5b;2&#x5d;. The example user used in the documentation is "3cxftpuser", not "FTP&#x5f;3cx". Additionally, the documentation notes that the FTP server can run on a different system from the 3CX software. For a backup, it would not make much sense to have it all run on the same system.&#xd;
