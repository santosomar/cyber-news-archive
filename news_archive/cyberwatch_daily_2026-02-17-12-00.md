### Title: 2026 64-Bits Malware Trend, (Mon, Feb 16th)
Link: https://isc.sans.edu/diary/rss/32718
Summary: In 2022 (time flies&#x21;), I wrote a diary about the 32-bits VS. 64-bits malware landscape&#x5b;1&#x5d;. It demonstrated that, despite the growing number of 64-bits computers, the "old-architecture" remained the standard. In the SANS malware reversing training (FOR610&#x5b;2&#x5d;), we quickly cover the main differences between the two architectures. One of the conclusions is that 32-bits code is still popular because it acts like a comme denominator and allows threat actors to target more Windows computers. Yes, Microsoft Windows can smoothly execute 32-bits code on 64-bits computers. It is still the case in 2026&#x3f; Did the situation evolved&#x3f;&#xd;
